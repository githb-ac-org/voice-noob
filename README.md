# Voice Noob

Build AI voice agents that handle phone calls. No PhD required.

---

## What Is This?

Voice Noob is an open-source platform for creating AI-powered phone agents. Configure an agent, connect a phone number, and let it handle calls — booking appointments, answering questions, or qualifying leads while you sleep.

**The problem:** Building voice AI is painful. You need to stitch together speech-to-text, LLMs, text-to-speech, telephony, and a dozen APIs. Then pray it doesn't sound like a robot.

**The solution:** Voice Noob handles the plumbing. Pick your AI tier, write a system prompt, enable tools, and deploy.
